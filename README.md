The assignment was to approach this job as if I was hired to clean up the html and css code for a fully functioning website.  

Horiseon is a company which offers services of search engine optimiztion, online reputation management, and social media marketing.  

The potential benefits for hiring Horiseon are lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management.

I completed the following in an effort to clean up the Horiseon website html and css code.


-checked that links operated properly.  links took webpage user directly to the corresponding box.
 
 -consolidated selectors and properties
 
 -organized html within a semantic structure.
 
 -created comments to help "translate" the html into layman's terms.
 
 -created sequential order for headings.
 
 -created greater accesibility for those viewing the Horiseon page through alternative means.
 

The Horiseon company webpage html and css code is now cleaner, more streamline, and ready to be built upon further.
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to share my services with your company.

Sincerely, 

          Tino Ganacias.
